                    Masachika Kuze is an unmotivated underachiever who routinely stays up late 
                    indulging in his nerdy hobbies. The girl who sits next to him in class, Alisa, 
                    constantly gets after him. While his grade may be on the lower end, 
                    he actually understands Russian because of his paternal grandfather, 
                    who was a big lover of Russian Culture.
